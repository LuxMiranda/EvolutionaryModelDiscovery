### folder "data" 
1. Copy results including factor counts and fitness values into data folder.
2. contain .csv data files
3. to convert these files into fANOVA format, go to "tools" folder and call the R script "convert-to-fanova.R", this script reads all .csv files in folder "files" and convert them to fANOVA output format:
	+ each .csv file is corresponding to one output folder
	+ all output folders are in "results/fANOVA/GP-Anasazi/"
	+ note: the Rscript "convert-to-fanova.R" calls "extract-param-file.R", so you need to stay in "tools" folder to call "convert-to-fanova.R"

### folder "results" 
1.contain data in fANOVA format for analysis
2. structure of each folder:
	+ param-file.txt: parameter definitions, generated by "extract-param-file.R"
	+ paramstrings-it1.txt: each line is one individual in the .csv file (identical individual should be grouped, but I don't do it at the moment, I'm just lazy :D)
	+ runs_and_results-it1.csv: each line is one run in the .csv file
3. to call fANOVA:
	+ call ./run.sh, output includes:
		- fANOVA.out: importance of single parameters and pairwise interactions
		- plots: marginal plots of all effects, which show the average cost of individual across the whole space when the corresponding parameter(s) is fixed.
4. extract fANOVA output:
	+ read-output.R: a script to extract effects with the importance not less than a certain threshold, for multiple runs.
